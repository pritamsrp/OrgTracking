Scripts for the mongo shell are written in JavaScript. To execute the file on the server, this JavaScript (.js) file has to be specified to a mongo shell instance.

Following are the steps to run a script file
1. Open command prompt
2. In the command prompt, navigate to the directory where mongo db binaries are stored (e.g. D:\Programs\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin)
3. To execute CommissionDetailCreate.js stored at location "D:\Commission Data", execute the following command from the command prompt

	D:\Programs\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin> mongo.exe "D:\Commission Data\CommissionDetailCreate.js"

   This will run the instructions in the CommissionDetailCreate.js file and perform actions accordingly.

Following are the files and the their uses
------------------------------------------
CommissionDetailCreate.js	 : Creates collection 'CommissionsDetails' in mongo db
CommissionDetailTestData.js	 : Adds test data to collection 'CommissionsDetails'
CommissionSummaryCreate.js	 : Creates collection 'CommissionsSummary' in mongo db
CommissionSummaryTestData.js : Adds test data to collection 'CommissionsSummary'

(Please note the the mongo db server should be running to execute the above command)
